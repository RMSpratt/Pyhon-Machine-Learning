# Pyhon-Machine-Learning

## High-Level Description

This repository will hold all of my small-scale machine learning projects developed for practicing the implementation of machine learning models and concepts for real-world applications. Many of the early projects will be motivated for gaining knowledge with popular machine learning libraries. I hope to have later projects that are developed more for fun applied to personal interests.
